Hi! Thanks for looking at my profile, my name is Eric Telkkälä.  

Currenly my repositories focus on the [Full Stack open 2022 course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/), but there's a miscellaneous selection of my school work there as well.  

My _current_ interests are:
- Web technologies and the variety of them[^1]
- Performance in computing[^2]


[^1]: Just interested why there's so many competitors/alternatives for front-end applications.
[^2]: Not that I know how to implement special tricks to boost your website's performance by 200 % :)
